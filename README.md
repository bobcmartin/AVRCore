# AVRCore
# Arduino support package for the AVR Dx/Ex Curiosity Nano Development boards
AVRCore is a fork from the DxCore AVR Dx suport spackage created by Spence Konde
It sinplifies the menu choices under the Tools Top Level directory by predening many of the options that are
specific to the Curiousity Nano boards. The DxCore Core suport package is geared towards the specific AVR DA, DB, DD , EA and EB parts themselves.
The standard Arduino API interface is exactly the same however some of the more enhanced functions are a bit different.
