## Boards Manager Installation 

This board package can be installed via the board manager. The boards manager URL is:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobcmartin/AVRCore/refs/heads/package_install/package_microchip_index.json`



File -> Preferences, enter the above URL in "Additional Boards Manager URLs"
Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager...
Wait while the list loads (takes longer than one would expect, and refreshes several times).
Select "DxCore by Spence Konde" and click "Install". For best results, choose the most recent version.
